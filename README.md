# python-challenge-1

My code for the the python-challenge-1 is in the [Final menu](https://github.com/mmccanse/python-challenge-1/blob/main/Final%20menu.py) file.  I consulted our class activities and notes as well as Chat GPT in the completion of this exercise.  I did not ask Chat GPT to write all the code for me. Instead I used it to ask questions about why something did or didn't work, or if I didn't understand something.
